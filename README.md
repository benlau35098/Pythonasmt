## Overview

This program is a bank simulator that allows users to withdraw and/or deposit money from a makeshift bank balance. It provides basic functionality to manage your virtual bank account through simple commands.

Version 1 contained a basic console user interface that was generally functional, but had a lot of flaws that had to be improved on. For example, you could only deposit or
withdraw once in your bank account.

Version 2 significantly built from version 1, as functions were utilized to organize my code, allowing it to be easier for me to make several improvements. Examples include
allowing the user to withdraw/deposit infnite times, more strict boundaries for user name and age.

Version 3 introduced a graphical user interface, easygui to my program. This signifiantly improved the layout, user friendliness and professionalism of my program, giving 
my users more value for their time. 

Version 4 cleaned up any shortcomings identified in any previous versions, and also took the extra step to import matplotlib, allowing for data visualization. The user can noe see their bank transaction history after finishing with their transactions, adding complexity and making my outcome stand out more.
